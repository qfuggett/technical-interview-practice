# Write a program that counts from 1 to 20 in fizzbuzz fashion.
# To do so, loop from 1 to 20 (inclusive). Each time through, 
# if the number is evenly divisible by 3, say ‘fizz’. If the number is evenly divisible by 5, 
# say ‘buzz’. If the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, say ‘fizzbuzz’. Otherwise, say the number.
